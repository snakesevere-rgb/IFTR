MealsMiles - Public Business Logic

This module contains the default business logic for the MealsMiles platform.
It is designed to be a transparent and functional baseline that allows
the application to run out-of-the-box.

**For Independent Developers & Forks:**
You can create your own proprietary logic by creating a 'math_logic_private.py'
file in this same directory. The application will automatically use your
private file if it exists, otherwise it will fall back to this public one.

This allows you to develop and test your own unique algorithms for pricing,
driver eligibility, and optimization without needing to alter the core
application code.
